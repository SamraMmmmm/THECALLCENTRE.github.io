# THECALLCENTRE.github.io
Landing page for THE CALL CENTRE; my monthly performance programme. Developed through the Peckham DAZ programme.

<h2>My First Webpage</h2>
<p> Here's a link to my first webpage. <br> https://samrammmmm.github.io/THECALLCENTRE.github.io/ <br> <br>I created it to host the video documentation for my monthly performance programme called, THE CALL CENTRE.</br></p>

<h2>A reflection of your learning process and the final outcome.</h2>
<p>I think the page is functional however with more time I would add the following; 
<ul> 
  <li>A weird leopard background that is animated,</li>
  <li>More interesting fonts and colour choices,</li>
  <li>An initial video trailer that plays before you view the page.</li>
</ul>

However the process has been really enjoyable and encouraging for me. I hope to continue learning and using my art practice to inspire more ambitious projects.</p>
